	abstract = {We have developed a multiple level-set method for inverting magnetic data produced by weak induced magnetization only. The method is designed to deal with a specific class of 3D magnetic inverse problems in which the magnetic susceptibility is known and the objective of the inversion is to find the boundary or geometric shape of the causative bodies. We adopt the conceptual representation of the subsurface geologic structure by a set of magnetic bodies, each having a uniform magnetic susceptibility embedded in a nonmagnetic background. This representation enables us to reformulate the magnetic inverse problem into a domain inverse problem for those unknown domains defining the supports of the magnetic causative bodies. Because each body may take on a variety of shapes, and we may not know the number of bodies a priori either, we use multiple level-set functions to parameterize these domains so that the domain inverse problem can be further reduced to an optimization problem of multiple level-set functions. To efficiently compute gradients of the nonlinear functional arising from the multiple level-set formulation, we take advantage of the rapid decay of the magnetic kernels with distance to significantly speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in the minimization process. We apply the new method to the synthetic and field data sets and determine its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {A two-step shape reconstruction method for electromagnetic (EM) tomography is presented which uses adjoint fields and level sets. The inhomogeneous background permittivity distribution and the values of the permittivities in some penetrable obstacles are assumed to be known, and the number, sizes, shapes, and locations of these obstacles have to be reconstructed given noisy limited-view EM data. The main application we address in the paper is the imaging and monitoring of pollutant plumes in environmental cleanup sites based on cross-borehole EM data. The first step of the reconstruction scheme makes use of an inverse scattering solver which recovers equivalent scattering sources for a number of experiments, and then calculates from these an approximation for the permittivity distribution in the medium. The second step uses this result as an initial guess for solving the shape reconstruction problem. A key point in this second step is the fusion of the `level set technique' for representing the shapes of the reconstructed obstacles, and an `adjoint field technique' for solving the nonlinear inverse problem. In each step, a forward and an adjoint Helmholtz problem are solved based on the permittivity distribution which corresponds to the latest best guess for the representing level set function. A correction for this level set function is then calculated directly by combining the results of these two runs. Numerical experiments are presented which show that the derived method is able to recover one or more objects with nontrivial shapes given noisy cross-borehole EM data.},

	abstract = {To realize large-scale or high-resolution structural topology optimization design, a fully parallel parameterized level set method with compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs) is developed based on both the uniform and non-uniform structured meshes. In this work, the whole computation process is parallelized, including mesh generation, sensitivity analysis, calculation and assembly of the element stiffness matrices, solving of the structural state equation, parameterization and updating of the level set function, and output of the computational results during the optimization iterations. In addition, some typical numerical examples, in which the calculation scale is up to 7 million 8-node hexahedral elements, are carried out for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, the computing time is also analyzed in detail. It is found that: (1) In the optimized structures, the thin sheet-like components gradually replace the truss-like ones when refining the mesh, (2) the parameterization process of the level set function will become fast as long as the non-uniformity of mesh is not very high and the supported radius of CSRBF is small enough, and (3) more than 80\% of the total computing time is always consumed for solving the structural state equation during the finite element analysis (FEA).},

	abstract = {In this paper, a parametric level set method for reconstruction of obstacles in general inverse problems is considered. General evolution equations for the reconstruction of unknown obstacles are derived in terms of the underlying level set parameters. We show that using the appropriate form of parameterizing the level set function results a significantly lower dimensional problem, which bypasses many difficulties with traditional level set methods, such as regularization, re-initialization and use of signed distance function. Moreover, we show that from a computational point of view, low order representation of the problem paves the path for easier use of Newton and quasi-Newton methods. Specifically for the purposes of this paper, we parameterize the level set function in terms of adaptive compactly supported radial basis functions, which used in the proposed manner provides flexibility in presenting a larger class of shapes with fewer terms. Also they provide a "narrow-banding" advantage which can further reduce the number of active unknowns at each step of the evolution. The performance of the proposed approach is examined in three examples of inverse problems, i.e., electrical resistance tomography, X-ray computed tomography and diffuse optical tomography.},

	abstract = {Difference geophysical tomography (e.g. radar, resistivity and seismic) is used increasingly for imaging fluid flow and mass transport associated with natural and engineered hydrologic phenomena, including tracer experiments, in situ remediation and aquifer storage and recovery. Tomographic data are collected over time, inverted and differenced against a background image to produce ‘snapshots’ revealing changes to the system; these snapshots readily provide qualitative information on the location and morphology of plumes of injected tracer, remedial amendment or stored water. In principle, geometric moments (i.e. total mass, centres of mass, spread, etc.) calculated from difference tomograms can provide further quantitative insight into the rates of advection, dispersion and mass transfer; however, recent work has shown that moments calculated from tomograms are commonly biased, as they are strongly affected by the subjective choice of regularization criteria. Conventional approaches to regularization (Tikhonov) and parametrization (image pixels) result in tomograms which are subject to artefacts such as smearing or pixel estimates taking on the sign opposite to that expected for the plume under study. Here, we demonstrate a novel parametrization for imaging plumes associated with hydrologic phenomena. Capitalizing on the mathematical analogy between moment-based descriptors of plumes and the moment-based parameters of probability distributions, we design an inverse problem that (1) is overdetermined and computationally efficient because the image is described by only a few parameters, (2) produces tomograms consistent with expected plume behaviour (e.g. changes of one sign relative to the background image), (3) yields parameter estimates that are readily interpreted for plume morphology and offer direct insight into hydrologic processes and (4) requires comparatively few data to achieve reasonable model estimates. We demonstrate the approach in a series of numerical examples based on straight-ray difference-attenuation radar monitoring of the transport of an ionic tracer, and show that the methodology outlined here is particularly effective when limited data are available.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of 3D shape reconstruction from multi-modal data, given uncertain calibration parameters. Typically, 3D data modalities can come in diverse forms such as sparse point sets, volumetric slices, 2D photos and so on. To jointly process these data modalities, we exploit a parametric level set method that utilizes ellipsoidal radial basis functions. This method not only allows us to analytically and compactly represent the object, it also confers on us the ability to overcome calibration-related noise that originates from inaccurate acquisition parameters. This essentially implicit regularization leads to a highly robust and scalable reconstruction, surpassing other traditional methods. In our results we ﬁrst demonstrate the ability of the method to compactly represent complex objects. We then show that our reconstruction method is robust both to a small number of measurements and to noise in the acquisition parameters. Finally, we demonstrate our reconstruction abilities from diverse modalities such as volume slices obtained from liquid displacement (similar to CT scans and XRays), and visual measurements obtained from shape silhouettes as well as point-clouds.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09815},
	abstract = {For inverse problems where one is concerned with recovering the shape and contrast of an unknown number of objects embedded in a medium, parametric level-set (PaLS) methods provide much of the ﬂexibility of traditional level-set methods while avoiding many of the diﬃculties such as regularization and re-initialization. In this paper, we consider the restoration and reconstruction of piecewise constant objects in two and three spatial dimensions using PaLEnTIR, a signiﬁcantly enhanced PaLS model relative to the current state-of-the-art. The primary contribution of this paper is a new PaLS formulation which requires only a single level-set function to recover a scene with piecewise constant objects possessing multiple unknown contrasts. Our model oﬀers distinct advantages over current approaches to the multi-contrast, multi-object problem, all of which require multiple level-sets and explicit estimation of the contrast magnitudes. Given upper and lower bounds on the contrast, our approach is able to recover objects with any distribution of contrasts and eliminates the need to know either the number of contrasts in a given scene or their values. We provide an iterative process for ﬁnding these space-varying contrast limits. Relative to most PaLS methods which employ radial basis functions (RBFs), our model makes use of anisotropic basis functions (ABFs), thereby expanding the class of shapes that a PaLS model of a given complexity can approximate. Finally, PaLEnTIR improves the conditioning of the Jacobian matrix required as part of the parameter identiﬁcation process and consequently accelerates the optimization methods by controlling the magnitude of the PaLS expansion coeﬃcients, ﬁxing the centers of the basis functions, and with the uniqueness of parametric to image mappings provided by the new parameterization. We demonstrate the performance of the new approach using both 2D and 3D variants of X-ray computed tomography, diﬀuse optical tomography (DOT), denoising, and deconvolution problems. Application to experimental sparse CT data and simulated data with diﬀerent types of randomness are performed to further validate the proposed method.},

Areas with subsurface salt bodies are of particular interest because they often have hydrocarbon reservoirs on their sides or underneath. Accurate reconstruction of their geometry is a challenge for current techniques. This paper presents a parametric level-set method for the reconstruction of salt-bodies in seismic full-waveform inversion. We split the subsurface model in two parts: a background velocity model and the salt body with known velocity but undetermined shape. The salt geometry is represented by a level-set function that evolves during the inversion. We choose radial basis functions to represent the level-set function, leading to an optimization problem with a modest number of parameters. A common problem with level-set methods is to ﬁne tune the width of the level-set boundary for optimal sensitivity. We propose a robust algorithm that dynamically adapts the width of the level-set boundary to ensure faster convergence. Tests on a suite of idealized salt geometries show that the proposed method is stable against a modest amount of noise. We also extend the method to joint inversion of both the background velocity model and the salt-geometry.},

First, most techniques cannot guarantee that the solution fits the data at inference. Second, while the derivation of the techniques is inspired by the existence of a valid scalar regularization function, such techniques do not in practice rely on such a function, and therefore veer away from classical variational techniques. In this work we introduce a new family of neural regularizers for the solution of inverse problems. These regularizers are based on a variational formulation and are guaranteed to fit the data.

In many problems the expected conductivity structure is well constrained in some parts of the subsurface, but incorporating prior in­ formation in the inversion is not a trivial task. In this study we developed an electrical resistivity tomography inversion algorithm that combines parametric and smooth inversion strategies. In regions where the subsurface is well constrained, the model was parameterized with only a few variables, while the rest of the subsurface was parameterized with voxels. We tested this hybrid inversion strategy on two synthetic models that contained a well constrained highly resistive or conductive near-surface horizontal layer and a target beneath. In each testing scenario, the hybrid inversion improved resolution of feature boundaries and magnitudes and had fewer inversion artifacts than the standard smooth inversion. A sensitivity analysis showed that the hybrid inversion successfully recovered subsurface features when a range of regularization parameters, initial models, and data noise levels were tested. The hybrid inversion strategy can potentially be expanded to a range of applications including marine surveys, permafrost/frozen ground studies, urban geophysics, or anywhere that prior infor­ mation allows part of the model to be constrained with simple geometric shapes.},

	abstract = {We have developed a method to invert time-domain airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data using a parametric level-set approach combined with a conventional voxel-based technique to form a parametric hybrid inversion. The approach was designed for situations in which a voxel-based inversion alone may struggle. Such an example is where a distinct anomaly is present with sharp boundaries, and there is a large contrast between a low-resistivity target and a high-resistivity background. The first step of the proposed hybrid method used our novel parametric inversion to recover a best-fitting skewed Gaussian ellipsoid that represented the target of interest. Subsequently, the parametric result was set as an initial and reference model for the second stage, where smooth features with smaller resistivity contrasts were introduced into the model through a conventional voxel-based approach. The approach was tested with synthetic and field data. In the synthetic case, we recovered the size and dip of a conductive, thin, dipping plate with better accuracy compared with a voxel-based inversion. In the field example, we inverted AEM data over the Caber volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit. Based on information from past drilling, our results improve upon previous parametric plate inversions of the deposit itself, while additionally imaging the conductive cover over the deposit. These findings showcased how our parametric hybrid method can improve the accuracy of time-domain AEM inversions for thin dipping targets with large resistivity contrasts compared with the background.},

The shape of each anomaly is a skewed Gaussian ellipsoid which can move, rotate and stretch in any direction until its optimal position is found. We ﬁrst tested the algorithm on synthetic data sets created over an earth model with multiple thin, steeply dipping conductors in a resistive background. This setting was designed to simulate a banded-iron exploration environment. The depth extent and dip of the recovered anomalies in the parametric inversions matched closely with the true synthetic model, and the results were considered an improvement over conventional voxel-based inversions. Subsequently, the approach was tested on ﬁeld data sets collected over the West Plains banded-iron gold exploration area in Nunavut, Canada. This provided new interpretations regarding the spatial location, depth and dip of the linear conductors in the area.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We introduce parametric level-set enhanced to improve reconstruction (PaLEnTIR), a significantly enhanced parametric level-set (PaLS) method addressing the restoration and reconstruction of piecewise constant objects. Our key contribution involves a unique PaLS formulation utilizing a single level-set function to restore scenes containing multi-contrast piecewise constant objects without requiring knowledge of the number of objects or their contrasts. Unlike standard PaLS methods employing radial basis functions (RBFs), our model integrates anisotropic basis functions (ABFs), thereby expanding its capacity to represent a wider class of shapes. Furthermore, PaLEnTIR streamlines the model by reducing redundancy and indeterminacy in the parameterization, resulting in improved numerical performance. We compare PaLEnTIR’s performance to state-of-the art alternatives via a diverse collection of experiments encompassing denoising, deconvolution, sparse and limited angle of view x-ray computed tomography (2D and 3D), and nonlinear diffuse optical tomography tasks using both real and simulated data sets.},
